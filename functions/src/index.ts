// This Firebase Functions directory is currently a placeholder.
// The automated client update CRON job functionality, previously considered for
// a Firebase Cloud Function, has been reverted.
//
// If you decide to implement other Firebase Cloud Functions (e.g., database triggers,
// complex background tasks, or a server-side CRON job in the future),
// you can add them here.
//
// To avoid deployment errors if this functions/src directory exists and is picked up by Firebase deploy,
// ensure no functions are exported here if you don't intend to deploy any from this file.
// For example, you can comment out or remove previous exports.

/*
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";
import * as admin from "firebase-admin";
admin.initializeApp();

// Example of a callable function (not related to CRON)
export const myExampleCallableFunction = functions.https.onCall((data, context) => {
  // ... your logic here
  return { message: "Hello from Firebase Cloud Function!" };
});
*/

// console.log("Firebase Functions `index.ts` loaded. No active functions for Kollab CRON job here.");
