// This file was previously used for a Firebase Cloud Function CRON job.
// The CRON logic has been reverted to a Next.js API Route (/api/cron/send-updates)
// to be triggered by an external service like Supabase Edge Functions or cron-job.org.
// This file can be deleted or kept if other Firebase Cloud Functions are planned for the project.

// To avoid deployment errors if this functions/src directory still exists and is picked up by Firebase deploy,
// ensure no functions are exported here if you don't intend to deploy any from this file.
// For example, you can comment out or remove previous exports.

/*
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";
// ... (previous imports and function definitions would go here)

export const myExampleFunction = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
  functions.logger.info("Hello logs!", {structuredData: true});
  response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});
*/

// If you are NOT using Firebase Cloud Functions at all, you can delete the entire 'functions' directory.
// If you ARE using other Firebase Cloud Functions, ensure only those are active here.

// console.log("Firebase Functions `index.ts` loaded. No CRON job function active here; CRON is via Next.js API route.");
